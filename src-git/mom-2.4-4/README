To use mom effectively, you should have the following installed:

1.  a) for mom versions 2.2 and higher, groff 1.22.4 or later
    b) for mom versions 1.2-x and higher, groff 1.19.2 or later
    c) for mom version 1.1.9, groff 1.19 or later
    d) for mom versions 1.1.3 to 1.1.8, groff 1.18 or later
    e) for versions of mom earlier than 1.1.3, groff 1.17-2

2.  A functioning print system; in GNU/Linux, that means lpr/
    lprng/cups or similar, with appropriate filters to output
    PostScript documents.

3.  In GNU/Linux, a working X server (not strictly necessary, but
    advisable).

4.  Working versions of gs (ghostscript) and gv (ghostview).

The documentation is written in html, so a browser (text-onlies
are just fine) or an editor capable of rendering html and
following links is a good idea, too.  The best way of using
the documentation is to open the table of contents file
(mom-<version>/momdoc/toc.html), and go from there.
